This project was made as a pet project and in order to have a substitute to PGAdmin. It currently only supports Postgres and as a result requires the Postgres [JDBC](https://pages.github.com/](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download/)). 
There are a few more things I would like to add to this, but I am not currently in a rush to add those changes.
